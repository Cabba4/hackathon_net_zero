Our app is called FleaGo. With FleaGo flea market customers can get reward points when shoppTing and the exchange them with goods. The app is for customers who physically go to the flea markets in Tampere and it's NOT an online shopping app.

There're two types of users for the app:

- The customers
- The shop keepers

-> The customers can register (for free) and the app will give them a unique QR code. Every time they shop at a flea market which is registered in FleaGo they can scan their QR code at the cashier and get reward points which will show in the app. The reward points are specific to the flea market where the customer has shopped in and can be spent only in that specific store.

-> The shop keepers can register by paying a monthly subscription and they can get access to the QR scanning through their phone's camera. Every time a FleaGo user shops at their store, the shop keepers can scan their QR code to grant them points.
