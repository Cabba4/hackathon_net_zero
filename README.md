# hackathon_net_zero
“From Hero to Net-Zero: Decarbonising The Cities” Hackathon aims to foster the creation of solutions that help mitigate the effects of the global warming.

A public API (or more than one) from the city of Tampere will be provided for the participants. This will be the team's starting point. From that, they will define how to use the available API for creating an application. 
All the tools and resources are defined by the team. No tools will be provided from the hackathon organization. This also means that teams have absolute freedom to define the software infrastructure to be used. The objective is to deliver a COMPLETE solution for the hackathon organization. By complete solution it is meant a SW application, a mobile application that can be easily run and tried out by the organizers. It is the responsibility of the team to provide the needed instructions as a README file for running and checking the solution. The delivery of the application is made via this GitHub repository. Teams are responsible for uploading the whole solution to the repo before the deadline. By the whole solution it is meant that all the needed files are uploaded to the provided location.
